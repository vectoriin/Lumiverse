# Permissions

Extensions have two tiers of capabilities.

## Free Tier (no declaration needed)

These are always available:

- **Events** — subscribe to any Lumiverse event
- **Storage** — read/write to your extension's scoped storage directory
- **Shared RPC Pool** — publish and read cross-extension latest-state endpoints
- **User Storage** — per-user isolated storage, even for operator-scoped (globally installed) extensions
- **Secure Enclave** — encrypted at-rest secret storage (AES-256-GCM), per-user isolated
- **Macros** — register custom `{{macros}}` for use in prompts
- **DOM** — inject sanitized HTML and CSS via the frontend DOM helper
- **Drawer Tabs** — register tabs in the ViewportDrawer sidebar
- **Input Bar Actions** — register actions in the chat input bar Extras popover
- **Variables** — read/write local (chat-scoped) and global (cross-chat) variables
- **Logging** — write to the server console
- **Toast Notifications** — show success/warning/error/info toasts in the frontend UI
- **Frontend <-> Backend messaging** — relay messages between your modules

## Gated Tier (must declare in `permissions` and be granted by the user)

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| `"generation"` | Fire LLM generations (raw, quiet, batch) on behalf of the user. Also grants access to list/inspect connection profiles. |
| `"interceptor"` | Register a pre-generation interceptor that can modify the prompt before it reaches the LLM |
| `"tools"` | Register LLM tools (function calling). Council-eligible tools appear in the Council tools list and can be assigned to members for pre-generation analysis |
| `"cors_proxy"` | Make HTTP requests through the Lumiverse server (bypass CORS) |
| `"context_handler"` | Register middleware that enriches the generation context before prompt assembly |
| `"generation_parameters"` | Inject provider-specific parameters (e.g. `response_format`, sampling overrides) into in-flight generations via interceptors. Requires `interceptor` to be useful |
| `"ephemeral_storage"` | Use temporary storage with TTL, memory pooling, and per-extension quotas |
| `"characters"` | Full CRUD on character cards (list, get, create, update, delete) |
| `"chats"` | CRUD on chat sessions (list, get, update, delete) + get active chat |
| `"presets"` | CRUD on user presets, prompt blocks, and derived category groups |
| `"world_books"` | Full CRUD on world books and their entries (list, get, create, update, delete) |
| `"databanks"` | Full CRUD on databanks and their documents (list, get, create, update, delete, reprocess, read parsed content) |
| `"memories"` | Full CRUD on the Memory Cortex (entities, relations, consolidations, salience, vaults, chat links) and long-term chat memory (vectorized chunks, top-K retrieval, warmup, cache) |
| `"personas"` | Full CRUD on personas (list, get, create, update, delete) + active switching + attached world book retrieval |
| `"chat_mutation"` | Read and modify chat messages (append, update, delete, hide/unhide, inspect raw message history) |
| `"event_tracking"` | Track, query, and replay extension-level telemetry events |
| `"ui_panels"` | Create floating widgets and docked edge panels that overlay/consume screen space |
| `"app_manipulation"` | Mount unrestricted portals into the document body that persist across routes. Also grants access to the Theme API for applying CSS variable overrides on top of the user's theme, and to `spindle.chat.setStyleMode` for opting individual chats out of the host's CSS containment sandbox so card-authored `position: fixed` content paints at viewport scope |
| `"oauth"` | Register an OAuth callback handler to receive authorization redirects from external services |
| `"push_notification"` | Send OS-level push notifications to users' devices even when the app is closed or backgrounded |
| `"image_gen"` | Generate images via image gen connection profiles. Also grants access to list providers, connections, and models |
| `"web_search"` | Run searches against the user's configured web search provider (currently SearXNG) and read the safe view of their web search settings. The host enforces all upstream limits — extensions cannot supply their own endpoint or API key |

Users grant permissions individually from the Extensions panel. Your extension should degrade gracefully if a permission isn't granted.

## Live Permission Updates

Permission changes take effect **immediately** — the extension does not restart when a user grants or revokes a permission. This means:

- The host enforces permissions on every API call in real time. A revoked permission blocks the very next request.
- Your extension receives a scoped `permission_changed` notification so it can react instantly (enable/disable features, update UI, re-register tools, etc.).
- The local permission cache (`spindle.permissions.has()`) is kept in sync automatically.
- Shared RPC on-demand handlers run under the endpoint's delegated permission policy during cross-extension calls, so they do not inherit unrelated owner permissions.

This makes permission management fast and seamless for users. Your extension should be designed to activate and deactivate features on the fly.

## Checking Permissions

### Synchronous Check (recommended)

Use `spindle.permissions.has()` for instant, zero-cost permission checks. It reads from a local cache that is seeded on startup and kept in sync by `permission_changed` messages:

```ts
if (spindle.permissions.has('generation')) {
  // Safe to use spindle.generate.* and spindle.connections.*
  await initGenerationFeatures()
}
```

This is ideal for gating features at startup or inside event handlers.

### Async Check

Use `spindle.permissions.getGranted()` to fetch the full list of granted permissions from the host. This performs an RPC roundtrip but is guaranteed to be authoritative:

```ts
const granted = await spindle.permissions.getGranted()
if (granted.includes('generation')) {
  // ...
}
```

## Handling Permission Denials

All permission-gated operations return structured errors when the required permission has not been granted.

### Request/Response Operations

For generation, connections, CORS, chat, events, and ephemeral storage, the returned error string is prefixed with `PERMISSION_DENIED:` followed by the permission name:

```ts
try {
  await spindle.generate.quiet({ messages: [...] })
} catch (err) {
  if (err.message.startsWith('PERMISSION_DENIED:')) {
    spindle.log.warn('Generation permission not granted — feature disabled')
  } else {
    spindle.log.error(`Generation failed: ${err.message}`)
  }
}
```

### Fire-and-Forget Registrations

For interceptors, tools, and context handlers, the host sends a `permission_denied` notification. Listen for these via `spindle.permissions.onDenied()`:

```ts
spindle.permissions.onDenied(({ permission, operation }) => {
  spindle.log.warn(`Permission "${permission}" denied for ${operation}`)
})

// This registration will silently no-op if "interceptor" isn't granted,
// but your onDenied handler will fire with the details.
spindle.registerInterceptor(async (messages, ctx) => { ... })
```

## Reacting to Permission Changes

Use `spindle.permissions.onChanged()` to respond when a user grants or revokes a permission at runtime. This is the core mechanism for building extensions that activate features on the fly:

The notification is delivered only to the worker for the extension whose grant changed. Other extensions do not receive it, so handlers can safely assume the event is scoped to their own extension.

```ts
spindle.permissions.onChanged(({ permission, granted, allGranted }) => {
  if (permission === 'generation') {
    if (granted) {
      spindle.log.info('Generation permission granted — enabling features')
      startGenerationFeatures()
    } else {
      spindle.log.info('Generation permission revoked — disabling features')
      stopGenerationFeatures()
    }
  }
})
```

The handler receives a `PermissionChangedDetail` object:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `permission` | `string` | The permission that changed |
| `granted` | `boolean` | `true` if granted, `false` if revoked |
| `allGranted` | `string[]` | Full list of currently granted permissions after the change |
| `extensionId` | `string` | Identifier of this extension |

You can also listen for the `PERMISSION_CHANGED` event via `spindle.on()`:

```ts
spindle.on('PERMISSION_CHANGED', (detail) => {
  // detail has the same shape as PermissionChangedDetail
})
```

`spindle.on('PERMISSION_CHANGED', ...)` is a local runtime event. It is not a generic EventBus subscription, and it is scoped the same way as `spindle.permissions.onChanged()`.

## Patterns

### Gate Features at Startup, Activate on Grant

The recommended pattern is to check permissions at startup, then listen for changes:

```ts
// ── Startup ──
if (spindle.permissions.has('generation')) {
  startGenerationFeatures()
}

if (spindle.permissions.has('tools')) {
  registerAllTools()
}

// ── React to live changes ──
spindle.permissions.onChanged(({ permission, granted }) => {
  switch (permission) {
    case 'generation':
      granted ? startGenerationFeatures() : stopGenerationFeatures()
      break
    case 'tools':
      granted ? registerAllTools() : unregisterAllTools()
      break
  }
})
```

### Deferred Registration

If your extension's core feature requires a gated permission, you can defer registration until the permission is granted:

```ts
let interceptorRegistered = false

function tryRegisterInterceptor() {
  if (interceptorRegistered) return
  if (!spindle.permissions.has('interceptor')) return

  spindle.registerInterceptor(async (messages, ctx) => {
    // Modify the prompt...
    return messages
  })
  interceptorRegistered = true
  spindle.log.info('Interceptor registered')
}

// Try immediately
tryRegisterInterceptor()

// Also try whenever permissions change
spindle.permissions.onChanged(({ permission, granted }) => {
  if (permission === 'interceptor' && granted) {
    tryRegisterInterceptor()
  }
})
```

### Graceful Degradation with User Feedback

Show the user what's missing using toast notifications:

```ts
async function generateSummary(chatId: string) {
  if (!spindle.permissions.has('generation')) {
    spindle.toast.warning(
      'Enable the "Generation" permission in the Extensions panel to use this feature.'
    )
    return null
  }

  const result = await spindle.generate.quiet({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize this conversation.' }],
  })
  return result
}
```
