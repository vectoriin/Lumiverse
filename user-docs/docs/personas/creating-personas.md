# Creating Personas

Setting up a persona takes just a minute and makes a noticeable difference in how the AI addresses and interacts with you.

---

## Creating a New Persona

1. Open the **Persona** panel (user icon in the sidebar)
2. Click **New Persona**
3. Fill in:
    - **Name** (required) — How the AI addresses you
    - **Title** — A short description shown in the persona card
    - **Description** — Your character's appearance, personality, and background
    - **Pronouns** — Subjective, objective, and possessive forms (e.g. *she / her / her*). These power the `{{personaSubjectivePronoun}}`, `{{personaObjectivePronoun}}`, and `{{personaPossessivePronoun}}` macros and reinforce the AI's grammar choices. Blank fields fall back to *they / them / their*.
4. Optionally:
    - Upload an **avatar**
    - Assign a **folder** for organization
    - Attach a **World Book** with personal lore
5. Click **Save**

## Setting a Default

Mark one persona as your **default** by toggling the default flag. The default persona is automatically active whenever you start a new chat (unless overridden by a character binding).

Only one persona can be default at a time — setting a new default automatically clears the previous one.

---

## Narrator Mode

Toggle the **Narrator** flag on any persona to mark it as a narrator rather than a self-insert. When active, `{{isNarrator}}` resolves to `"yes"` in prompts.

This is useful for players who don't role-play as a specific character — they're directing the story rather than participating as a persona. Preset creators can use `{{if::{{isNarrator}}}}` to adjust instructions accordingly (e.g., shifting from second-person to third-person narration, or omitting persona descriptions).

---

## Switching Personas

You can switch personas at any time:

- **Persona panel** — Click on a different persona to activate it
- **Input area** — Use the persona switcher dropdown in the chat input actions
- **Per-chat** — Each chat remembers which persona is active

Switching personas mid-chat takes effect on the next generation. Previous messages keep the persona that was active when they were generated.

## Writing a Good Description

Your persona description fills in the `{{persona}}` macro in presets. Here's what works well:

```
Name: Alex Chen
Age: 28
Appearance: Tall with dark hair, usually wearing a leather jacket and jeans.
Casual and a bit sarcastic. Works as a freelance photographer.
Has a dry sense of humor and tends to deflect with jokes when uncomfortable.
```

!!! tip "Match the character's detail level"
    If you're chatting with a highly detailed character, a detailed persona helps the AI create balanced, two-sided interactions. For casual chats, a brief description is fine.

## Organizing with Folders

Assign personas to folders to group them visually:

- "Fantasy OCs"
- "Modern Settings"
- "Quick/Generic"

Personas without a folder appear in a general group. Folders are free-text labels — just type the folder name and personas with the same label are grouped together.

---

## Duplicating Personas

Click **Duplicate** on any persona to create a copy. The duplicate is never set as default and gets "(Copy)" appended to its name. Useful for creating variations of the same character for different scenarios.
