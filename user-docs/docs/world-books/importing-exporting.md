## Sharing Tips

!!! tip "Export as Lumiverse format for full fidelity"
    The Lumiverse export format preserves all advanced settings (sticky, cooldown, delay, groups, vectorization). Other formats may lose some of these features.

!!! tip "Embed in character exports"
    When you export a character as PNG or CHARX, attached world books are embedded automatically. This is the easiest way to share a character with their lore.

!!! tip "Clean up before sharing"
    Remove personal or campaign-specific entries before exporting a world book for public use. Keep entries generic enough to be useful in different contexts.
