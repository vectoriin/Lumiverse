# Chatting

Chatting is the heart of Lumiverse. Once you have a character and a connection set up, everything revolves around the conversation.

## How a Chat Works

When you send a message, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. Your message is saved to the chat
2. Lumiverse assembles the full **prompt** — your preset blocks, character data, persona, world book entries, chat history, and any active macros
3. The assembled prompt is sent to your AI provider via the active **connection**
4. Tokens stream back in real time, appearing word-by-word in the chat
5. When generation finishes, the complete response is saved as a message

The entire prompt assembly process is configurable through [Presets](../presets/index.md), and you can preview exactly what the AI sees using the **Dry Run** feature.

## Chat Management

From the **Landing Page** or the **Manage Chats** modal, you can:

- **View recent chats** — Grouped by character with last message previews
- **Delete chats** — Remove conversations you no longer need
- **Export chats** — Save the full conversation as JSON data
